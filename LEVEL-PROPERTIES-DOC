This document describes the YAML markup nessisary for .lvl files.
This is the version 0.1 spec. The 0.1 spec is implemented in block.rb

Each level (.lvl file) will have an accociated .yml file with the same name. (i.e. level1.lvl with have a level1.yml file)
Each .yml file will be defined as a ruby hash. (example hash will be called "data")

Properties.
	1: Health
	data[:health][sprite_number] = health
	where sprite_number is the index number of the loaded sprite
	where health is the number of desired hits it takes to destroy a tile
	
How to create with properties editor:
	You need to have ruby-GNOME2 installed (http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/hiki.cgi?Install+Guide )
	run the command:
		ruby properties.rb
	Enter the path to the level in the input box labeled "Level"
	LEAVE OUT THE FILE EXTENSION!
	Press Load Level
	
	It will then show the sprites you used for that level, along with their health values
	change to the desired settings
	
	press the Save button.
	
	You are now done, you can edit another level's properties or quit the application
	
How to create via ruby script/irb:
	Until a proper GUI editor is made for these files, you will have to either write them by hand, or using ruby.
	Opening up irb and doing this:
		data = {}
		data[:health] = {}
	Should set you up, all you have to do is fill in the actuall properties
	This code should save your file:
		require 'yaml'
		output = File.new 'mylvl.yml', 'w'
		output.puts YAML.dump(data)
		output.close
	Place the outputted file in the directory with you .lvl file, and you're done!
