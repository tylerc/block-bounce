Abstract
	This program allows you to create levels for the block bounce game
	These levels are made of sprites from the sprite editor (see SPRITE-DOC for more details)

Program Start
	The Level Editor starts via the command
		ruby -rubygems level.rb
	You are then presented with a window split up by a grid (this is where your sprites will go)
	Each sprite in the grid is 64x32 (width x height)
	Below the grid is a list of a sprites currently loaded
	
Controls
	The name of the selected sprite, and whether or not it is the player sprite is
		displayed in the window caption
	
	left mouse button - Selects a tile/Places a selected tile
	right moust button - Deletes a tile
	s - saves the level being edited
	a - saves the level edited under the specified name
	l - loads a level
	left shift - asks for the name of a sprite and loads it
	h - toggles the display of the grid
	Ctrl + left mouse button - line tool. fills the grids you move
		to with the sprite you started with (until Ctrl is released)
	q - cancels the current command (like loading a sprite)
