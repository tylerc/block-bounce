<h2>Block-Bounce</h2>
<h3>Written by: Tyler Church</h3>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This game is a simple breakout clone.<br />
I am making this for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
	<li>To test and improve my development skills</li>
	<li>To create a reusable tile engine</li>
	<li>To create a tile map editor</li>
	<li>To create a game with physics!</li>
</ul>
