h2(description). Description

This game is a simple breakout clone.
I am making this for a few reasons:

* To test and improve my development skills
* To create a reusable tile engine
* To create a tile map editor
* To create a game with physics!

h2. Running The Game

Simply run @block.sh@ (usually a double click) 

or, if you prefer the command line:

@sh block.sh@

h2. Playing The Game

h3. In The Menu:
* Start starts a game that plays through all levels (your progress is saved if you quit)
* Continue continues a game from where you left off
* Play Level lets you choose a specific level to play
* Options lets you turn on and off FX, change the speed of the ball, reset progress, and reset everything
* Quit quits the game

h3. In Game:
* Your mouse moves the blue paddle
* You goal is to destroy all the blocks on the screen
* Blocks occasionally drop "powers", which alter certain parts of the game
* Press 'p' to pause the game
* Press Escape (ESC) to quit
* HINT: Some powers are good, some bad, its up to you to figure out which are which
* HINT: The ball bounces at a different angle depending on where it hits the paddle

h2. Running The Level Editor

@ruby -rubygems level.rb@
* See doc/LEVEL-DOC for full information
* See doc/LEVEL-PROPERTIES-DOC for information on adding level properties

h2. Running the Level Properties Editor

@ruby -rubygems properties.rb@

Sorry, but I don't package the properties editor with the game, but you can follow the instructions in LEVEL-PROPERTIES-DOC if you would like to write the level properties by hand

h2. Running The Sprite Editor

h4. It is recommended that you do NOT use the sprite editor. Just use a different program and save to a .bmp file

@sh sprite.rb@

See doc/SPRITE-DOC for full information
