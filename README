== Block-Bounce
== Written by: Tyler Church

== Description
This game is a simple breakout clone.
I am making this for a few reasons:

* To test my development skills
* To create a reusable tile engine
* To create a tile map editor
* To create a game with physics!

**This game is currently no where close to release. You've been warned**

== Running The Game
You need Rubygame installed (as a gem) to play the game
To run the game use the command:
ruby -rubygems block.rb
